# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository explores the concept of **Requirement Analysis** within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It aims to provide learners with a clear understanding of how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated before the actual development begins.  

The contents of this repository cover:
- Definition and importance of Requirement Analysis
- Key activities involved
- Types of requirements
- Use case diagrams
- Acceptance criteria examples
