The Requirement Analysis Project builds a solid foundation for software development by documenting and analyzing requirements for a booking management system. It guides learners through real-world tasks to create clear, structured, and precise requirements that ensure successful project execution.
# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository explores the concept of **Requirement Analysis** within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It aims to provide learners with a clear understanding of how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated before the actual development begins.  

The contents of this repository cover:
- Definition and importance of Requirement Analysis
- Key activities involved
- Types of requirements
- Use case diagrams
- Acceptance criteria examples
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, understanding, and documenting what a software system should do.  
It involves gathering information from stakeholders such as clients, users, and developers to define the system's goals and features clearly.

This process ensures that the development team and the client have a shared understanding of what needs to be built.  
It is a critical step in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it forms the foundation for design, coding, and testing.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is crucial in software development for several reasons:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**  
   It ensures all stakeholders have a clear, common understanding of what the system should do, reducing confusion and rework.

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Identifying requirements early avoids costly changes later during design or implementation.

3. **Improves Product Quality**  
   Well-defined requirements lead to better designs and more accurate testing, resulting in a higher-quality software product.
